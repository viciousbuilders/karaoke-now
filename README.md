## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # add your LiveKit + PartyKit credentials
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

```
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTY_HOST=your-project.partykit.dev
```

### PartyKit secrets

The public room listing is write-gated on a shared token. Set it once per deployed
project, before `npm run deploy:party`:

```bash
partykit env add REGISTRY_TOKEN   # any long random string
```

Without it, a deployed registry rejects every write and `/browse` stays empty. Local
dev needs nothing: writes from `localhost` are exempt.

## Architecture

```
Browser A (Singer)                       Browser B (Listener)
  |-- getUserMedia (mic)                   |-- Receives the singer's voice track
  |    mic -> effects -> gain --+          |-- Own YouTube IFrame player
  |                             |          |-- Auto voice-sync offset
  |                             +-> voice track -> LiveKit SFU
  |-- Own YouTube IFrame player (clock authority)
  |     video-load / video-sync -> PartyKit -> video-state -> every client
  +-- PartyKit (room state, chat, queue, clock sync)
```

Only voice travels over LiveKit. Each client plays the same YouTube video locally
and corrects drift against the server-stamped `wallTime` in `video-state`, so the
singer never hears their own music delayed.
